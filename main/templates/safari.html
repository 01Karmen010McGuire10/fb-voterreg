            <p>By default, Safari blocks cookies set by third parties. This is a good thing&mdash;it prevents you from being tracked by advertisers&mdash;but Facebook applications are unfortunately considered third parties.</p>
            <p>We <em>could</em> work around the restriction, but that would involve exposing your data in a way that could violate your expectations of privacy. We don't want to do that, but we <em>do</em> want you to register to vote and get your friends to do the same.</p>
            <p>Would you mind enabling third-party cookies for the time being? It's really easy. </p>
